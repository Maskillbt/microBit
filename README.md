MU installation (BROWED FROM http://blog.gbaman.info/?p=727)
Windows

If you have Windows computers, you can grab Mu (a single .exe file, no installation needed) from the Github page https://github.com/ntoll/mu (or a direct link to the downloads page http://ardublockly-builds.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=microbit/windows/).

If you want to be able to use the REPL (highly recommended) you will also need to download and install mbed driver.

It is well worth it, although you are able to do it without it. You just won’t have access to the REPL.

Mac / Linux

On Mac OS and Linux, you can download the single executable applications from the Github page https://github.com/ntoll/mu (or a direct link to the downloads page for Mac OS http://ardublockly-builds.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=microbit/osx/ and Linux http://ardublockly-builds.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=microbit/linux/).
There is no mbed driver needed for Mac OS/Linux as it is built in, it is built in so you can use the REPL straight away!

Raspberry Pi

There are specific versions of Mu for the Raspberry Pi! So if you want to use the Microbit with a Pi, you will soon be able to simply type “sudo apt-get install mu”, although unfortunately that isn’t ready just yet. The direct link to the Raspberry Pi versions can be found here http://ardublockly-builds.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/?prefix=microbit/raspberry_pi/.
